Summary:

In my last project "bee-apiary website" i maked a mistake. Against creating subpages i decided to do dynamically changing content. Maybe it's sound great but that choice had influence to the SEO score. So now, i created many subpages, wich customer should edit and put some more describe (i do not know much about photocopying machines etc). On this site i didn't maked so many errors like on my last website... I hanged strong with semantic meaning of tags, proper size of images and learn new tricks. I think i make few more pages then master my OOP and react skills, thanks if you 're read to the end buddy.

Yours,
Wiktor 'NoxaGen'  Augustyniak
